  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective date: July 16, 2025</p>

  <p>
    Brain Game (“the app”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) offers a collection of brain-training mini games.
    This Privacy Policy explains what information is collected when you use the app, how it is used,
    and your choices.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not ask you to create an account and we do not collect personally identifiable information.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage &amp; Device Data:</strong> Non-identifying information such as device model, OS version, app version, and in-app activity may be collected by our advertising provider to deliver and measure ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising Identifier:</strong> Your device’s advertising ID (e.g., AAID/IDFA) may be used for ad delivery and frequency capping.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, operate, and improve the app.</li>
    <li>Show ads and measure their performance.</li>
    <li>Maintain app security and comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We use the Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) SDK to display advertisements. These services may collect data sent by your device
    (including the advertising identifier) to provide, personalize, and measure ads. Learn more here:

  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The app is not specifically directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
    If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personalized Ads:</strong> You can limit or reset your device’s advertising ID and opt out of personalized ads from your device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> If the app requests optional permissions, you can grant or revoke them in your device settings at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We do not store personal information on our servers. Third-party partners (e.g., AdMob) may retain pseudonymous data as described in their policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>

    We use reasonable safeguards to protect information processed by the app. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>International Users</h2>
  <p>
    Data may be processed on servers outside your country. By using the app, you consent to such processing consistent with this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
